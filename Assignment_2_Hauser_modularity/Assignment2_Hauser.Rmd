<!--***DAN: Overall excellent effort! The code has problems in various ways, as you have observed (see also my comments below and my solutions), but you did a great effort on all parts of the assignment, and that's what the grade is based on, so 10/10. I really appreciate that you were so critical of your own code that you wrote extensive comments on how it could be done better! That's how you get better at this, so keep it up. I have not always solved all your problems in my below comments because one consistent theme was similarities between what you wrote in your comments you would have liked to do, and the approach of the solutions I have already distributed to you. So I recommend you spend some time going through those solutions. If you have any questions about them, please feel free to knock on my door.-->

It would be better to make a loop and read them in as a list, over which each of the subsequent modules can run for loops (This would also make it really easy to add in other climate parameters later with new datasets). I've been having trouble getting this to run, though, which is why I include pseudocode (below) for what I want to do rather than actual working code.

## Abstract
  In the context of global climate change, United States climates are often less scrutinized because socioeconomic infrastructure makes climate impacts less obvious. In this study, we leverage the increased availability of US climate data to examine the extent of US climate change, specifically asking whether the country is experiencing a uniform warming trend. We observe that the States have seen significant changes in climate over the past half century but that climate shifts are characterized by regional extremes in either increasing or decreasing temperature and precipitation, with mid-western regions becoming warmer and drier and coastal regions becoming cooler and/or wetter. Regional trends will help inform policy makers as they alter United States infrastructure in response to heightened extreme weather events. 

## Introduction
  Studies increasingly acknowledge that climates have been shifting over the past several decades and will continue to change in coming years in response to human environmental impacts [@Walsh2014, @Wang2010]. Although climate change was initially couched as "global warming", more recent observations suggest that we may experience both warming and cooling trends, characterized instead by more frequent temperature and precipitation extremes [@Karl1996]. These extreme events are already felt in warmer drier countries, particuarly in Africa and Asia where the infrastructure to handle repeated extreme climate events is not strong [@Patz2005]. In the United States, however, more temperate climates and a socioeconomic standing that permits relatively quick responses to extreme weather events often makes the impacts of climate change go unacknowledged [@Patz2005]. United States climate data is accumulating daily, though, such that a thorough analysis of temperature extremes is possible. This study aims to determine the extent to which temperature and precipitation patterns have changed in the United States over the past several decades, and whether observed changes represent overall warming trends or rather, an increase in climate extremes.

## Methods
####Data acquisition

  In this study, we obtained temperature ($^{\circ}$C)and precipitation (inches) data from the Applied Climate Information System (ACIS) from 1950 to present. These data represent multpile sites in each of the 50 states, however we excluded sites for which less than 40 years of climate data had been collected. This gave us `r nrow(CTempMat)` sites of temperature data and `r nrow(CPrecipMat)` sites of precipitation data. 
  
####Statistical Analyses
  We ran linear regression analyses on temperature and precipitation data from each site over the course of the last `r ncol(CTempMat)` years. We the minimum, maximum, and average rates of temperature and precipitation change and the percent of sites where changes were statistically significant. We then plotted rate of temperature and precipitation change according to latitude and longitude to visually assess spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation change rates.

## Results
  Temperature data collected since 1950 indicate an average rate of temperature change across the United States that is nearly 0 (Table 1). However, `r round(TempPercentSignif*100)`% of temperatures experienced significant rates of change with `r round(length(which(RValsT > 0))/length(RValsT)*100)`% of sites experiencing temperature rise and  `r 100-(round(length(which(RValsT > 0))/length(RValsT)*100))`% of sites experiencing temperature decrease. 
  
  For precipitation, `r round(length(which(RValsPr > 0))/length(RValsPr)*100)`% of sites saw increased rates of precipitation, while precipitation declined at `r 100-(round(length(which(RValsPr > 0))/length(RValsPr)*100))`% of sites over the course of the study years. During the sampling period, `r round(PrecipPercentSignif*100)`% of sites experienced significant changes in precipiation rate.

  Mapped data show regional trends in temperature and precipitation changes (Figs. 1 & 2). Temperatures appear to show warming trends in mid-western and northern regions, while coastal regions, particularly the West Coast, appear to experience cooling trends (Fig. 1).

## Conclusions
 Although the effects of climate change in the United States are often percieved as subtle compared to other locations around the globe [@Patz2005], changes in temperature and precipitation are becoming progressively more obvious in the US [@Walsh2014]. Our data from the ACIS corroborate growing evidence that climate is changing in the United States. Although we observed minimal change in the mean temperature and precipitation across the country over the course of the past half century (Table 1), we observed that approximately half of our sites experienced temperature and precipitation increases while the other half experienced decreases. This suggests that the mean temperature change is not the most representative metric of changes in US climate, and that US climate change is instead characterized by enhanced temperature and precipitation extremes.
  Our findings are in agreement with recent studies demonstrating that, not only are climates changing in the US, but that temperature and precipition increases and decreases are regional [@Mutiibwa2015]. Mutiibwa et al. (2015) show that warming trends are greatest in the Mid-West and Northeast, while cooling trends dominate the West Coast. This trend is further supported with recent data from NASA's Earth Observatory, showing regionality of US temperature changes (Fig. 3). 

<!--Chunk showing outside source temp change map (from NASA)
  Although these next 2 chunks do not really rely on above code input, I labeled them to make code more extensible (Modularity tip 2)-->  
```{r, echo = F, fig.cap="Figure 3. Map of United States temperature change between 1991 and 2012, as observed by the NASA Earth Observatory.", fig.height=.5, fig.width=1}
knitr::include_graphics("https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/83000/83624/temperature_nca-1991-2012_lrg.jpg", dpi=100)
```

  Likewise, precipitation changes show a great deal of regionality with eastern increases and mid-western decreases (Fig. 4) [@Karl1996]. 
  
<!--Chunk showing outside source precip change map (also from NASA)-->
```{r, echo = F, fig.cap="Figure 4. Map of United States precipitation change between 1991 and 2012, as observed by the NASA Earth Observatory.", fig.height=.5, fig.width=1}
knitr::include_graphics("https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/83000/83624/Precipitation_nca_1991-2012_lrg.jpg", dpi=100)
```
  
  Thus, it appears that climate data collected over the past ~50 years depict a United States climate that is far from static. Although temperature and precipitation averages may not express the shifting climate regimes, the country is experiencing regionally-based increases and decreases in both temperature and precipitation. In the coming years, this may lead us to expect greater regional variability and an increase in extreme weather events.
